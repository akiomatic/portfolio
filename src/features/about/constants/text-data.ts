## Who am I?
Hello, again! I'm **_Akio Osawa_**, a passionate and dedicated **programmer** from Japan. I started coding back when I was 13, to solve problems that I encountered while playing the video game. Since then, I quickly fell in love with programming and have been on a journey to **master** it ever since.

## Minecraft and Me
At the age of 12, I came across **Minecraft**, which significantly influenced my career path. I was initially just a player, but I soon discovered that I could become a **server owner** and **customize** the game environment however I wanted. From there, I spent countless hours learning how to **code** and **configure** my servers, which made me realize the excitement of **turning ideas into reality**. At the start, I was completely unfamiliar with programming and English, but I gradually grasped these by watching YouTube tutorials and mimicking the code I saw. This experience was my first step into the world of programming and has indeed shaped me into who I am today in **Canada**.

By the way, in my free time, I still play Minecraft and sometimes enjoy Animal Crossing, which helps me relax and fuel my creativity in unexpected ways.`;
