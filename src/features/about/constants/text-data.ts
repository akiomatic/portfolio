In 2015, I came across a game that significantly influenced my career path: **Minecraft**. I didn't just play it for fun; it gave me a chance to **create** and **customize* a world or a server **through coding**. While designing **plugins** and altering the game environment, I became deeply engrossed in **turning ideas into reality** in Java. It was a huge eye-opener. The ability to solve problems and build things in a digital world sparked a real interest in programming for me.

Now, I find myself in Canada, pursing my dream to become a **front-end developer**. This field, for me, is the perfect canvas to blend my programming skills with my passion for creating **intuitive**, **visually compelling** user experiences. It's here that I aim to **innovate** and **contribute** to the digital world, inspired by the same **curiosity** that Minecraft ignited in me years ago.

By the way, in my free time, I still play Minecraft and enjoy Animal Crossing, which helps me relax and fuel my creativity in unexpected ways.`;
